# Face Recognition using LBPH

This repository demonstrates face recognition using the LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) algorithm and OpenCV. It includes detection using Haar cascades and training/testing pipelines.

## Contents
- `face-recognition-task-6.1.ipynb`: Training and evaluation of the LBPH face recognizer.
- `face-recognition-task-6.2.ipynb`: Advanced demonstration or additional task (see notebook for details).
- `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`: Haar cascade for detecting faces.
- `pywhatkit_dbs.txt`: (Explain its purpose if relevant)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebook

## Running the Project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the notebooks in Jupyter.
3. Download the Haar cascade XML (if not present).
4. Run the code cells step by step.

## Credits
- LBPH implementation using OpenCV
- Haar cascade from OpenCVâ€™s GitHub
